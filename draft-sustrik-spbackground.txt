Internet-Draft                SP Background                  August 2011


1.  Introduction

   The world of Internet is moving in a very specific direction.  As
   clients are almost constantly online, the need for client-side
   software diminishes.  Thin client becomes the norm.  Users are happy
   to lose the control of their data and software just to get rid of the
   need for administration.  Service providers, on the other hand, are
   happy to trade thick clients for extremely low time-to-market
   provided by application executed in the browser, with client-side
   code downloaded just in time from the server.

   In short, the world looks more and more like a collection of
   centralised services, each forming its own star-like topology,
   service provider being in the middle and thin clients on the edges.

   This trend is further amplified by the fact that no two services are
   exactly the same.  There's not much point in designing public
   protocols to allow distribution of a service that's provided by a
   single provider or maybe a handful of providers at best.

   IETF already reflects this trend.  As "Web Applications: Trends and
   Implications" [1] Internet draft says: "In a nutshell, there is a
   certain class of applications for which the standardization need is
   diminishing: chances are good that your standardization work will not
   be relevant in such an environment."

   However, there's a different trend emerging behind the scenes.
   There's an increased need for services to use other services.  It
   often makes sense to offload a specific functionality to an online
   service and focus on what you are good at instead of competing with
   existing service providers in the functionality you are not expert at
   and which you are probably not even interested in.  Even more
   importantly, by using other services you can reach the users centered
   around those services, which in turn means getting a traction far
   more quickly than you would get marketing the product in the old-
   fashioned way.  Finally, automated access to services allows for
   combining multiple services in an innovative way to deliver added
   value to the user.

   All these trends are already visible in the online world: software-
   as-a-service paradigm, delivering applications via social networking
   sites, just-in-time serving of ads provided by external companies,
   migrating data between different online services etc.

   Given that services using other services require much more precise
   contract than human beings who are generally all right with loosely
   defined "graphical user interface", these new trends lead to re-
   emergence of protocols, although in a slightly mutated manner.

   Online services already provide "APIs" for developers to hook in.
   Unfortunately, these are entirely ad hoc.  The same functionality is
   re-invented and re-implemented over and over again.  The APIs tend to
   be buggy and insecure.  The interactions with underlying network is
   almost universally ignored.

   Thus, it seems there's a need for standardised application-level
   protocols here, however, not the classic application protocols that
   convey business logic -- the business logic is different for each
   service anyway -- but protocols to handle pieces of functionality
   that are common to large number of services.

   Such functionality invariably has to deal with the most low-level
   aspects of the application protocols, namely abstraction of the
   underlying network and interaction with it as well as the generic
   communication patterns between services.

   This memo provides a background, both historic and technical, and a
   rationale for such a layer and discusses some of the associated use
   cases.
